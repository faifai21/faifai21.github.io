Well, it seems like I've succeeded. Or maybe failed. I was never a person to blog, and I've never had the slightest urge to blog. Well, change is always a good thing, we learn through change. Now is the time for me to learn about Jekyll and very simple blogging.

Before I start pouring my soul into this thing, an introduction is perhaps in order. My name is Faisal Alqadi and, right now, I am a student in the University of Waterloo. I am a computer engineering student, and will graduate in 6 months time (April 2014 can't come fast enough). Interests include physical activities, because I'm lazy and I'll be damned if that means I have to get fat. I also like coding and learning new technologies: I just started learning Android development and Ruby-on-Rails and it's oodles of fun. More on that in some future post. But who cares about my interests (other than me of course).

The reason I've come around to blogging is because I want to keep tabs of the projects I've participated in so far. Granted, I probably should have set this up at the beginning of my university career and blogged whenever I was actually in the project, but whatever. I'll have to rely on my trusty memory and what I've saved of the projects. 

On top of the school-related projects, I'll also touch upon the projects I had to work on while on co-op (internships).

Without further adeu, let's get started.
