##Company Background
This work term was my first work term. It started in the beginning of January of 2010 and ended at the end of April of the same year. Four months in total, which is usually the length of time for most work terms in UW. The location of the job was in Dubai, UAE. I had acquired this opportunity thanks to my father (he had many connections, being a businessman). The nature of the company was point-of-sales. It dealt with credit card machines, time-logging solutions for employees, cashiers and other point-of-sales doohickies. 

##The Project
The company was looking to create a loyalty program framework. Since they set up all the point-of-sales for their clients, it seemed like a great idea to also offer up a loyalty program for the clients' customers. A customer can sign up for the loyalty program, get a membership card, gain points with every purchase and redeem those points to pay for purchases as well as prizes and gifts. The membership card would have a smart chip (the kind that every credit card has nowadays), which would be used to store the customer information, the amassed points and other tidbits of information.

##My Role
I was to build the loyalty program from scratch. The entire thing. It seemed daunting. It was daunting. I was supposed to do it in C (or C++, my memory is a bit fuzzy on the language). I had no experience with C(++). I also had no experience with building frameworks, or working with cards and the smart chips on them. I was going to learn a lot this term. Now, if this work term happened a couple of months ago, I'd actually fill this up a lot more. But, that being said, I don't recall many specifics, so I'll just summarize the term. I did learn a lot. I was working under a brilliant software engineer, who taught me everything I needed to know about C(++) and the point-of-sales machines I was to be working with (when he wasn't busy chewing tobacco, that is). The first few weeks were rough, as should be expected. It was a challenge to get my development environment set up, as well as getting the hang of the technology that I was to be messing with. Eventually, I did get the hangs of things. By the end of the term, I had built the foundations of the loyalty program. Nothing too crazy. A sale would go through, and the machine would prompt the employee to insert the customer's loyalty card. The loyalty would be inserted, and the data in the smart chip would be read. The customer would then be given a choice: Either use the existing points to pay for some or all of the transaction, or just gain a certain amount of points. As well, I had implemtented a feature where the client could define happy hours. Customers who gained points during happy hours would get double or triple the points. This would act to attract customers and increase business. Since I was just one first year student working on this project, the project had many flaws and shortcomings. I'd say I finished 10% of the project, if that. It probably got redesigned and refactored multiple times after I handed it off. I wouldn't even recognize it now, though I doubt I would have recognized my original code right now.

##Thoughts
It was good. I learned a whole bunch. I worked with a very talented software engineer who taught me a lot. I also got to spend four months with my family and highschool friends!
